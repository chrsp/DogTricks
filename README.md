# Dog Tricks - A GraphQL Server üê∂

Dog Tricks is a Java server built with Spring Boot that provides a list of dog tricks via **GraphQL**.

## Getting Started

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **JDK 17**
- **Gradle**
- **IntelliJ IDEA**

## Running the Server

Clone this repository, navigate to its folder, and execute the following command:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

## Validating the Setup

Once the server is running, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080/graphiql`. This will open GraphiQL, an interactive playground to run your GraphQL queries. For example:

#### Fetch a Dog Trick by ID

```graphql
query {
  trickById(id: "1") {
    id
    name
    description
  }
}
```

#### Fetch All Dog Tricks

```graphql
query {
  dogTricks {
    id
    name
    description
  }
}
```
